I've recently submitted my `MA research proposal <https://db.tt/4h5u179a>`__, titled: "Audio-Only Augmented
Reality System for Social Interaction".
Usually, research proposals aims to present the subject and describe
the intents of the current research. This one is a bit more
comprehensive, presenting a fully operated system I've developed,
preliminary results of the system evaluation, and the exact design for a
future experiment.
Feedback is always welcome.
