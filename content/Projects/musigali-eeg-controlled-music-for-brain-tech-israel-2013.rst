A project by Giori Politi, Sharon Duek, Jonathan Abramson and myself
which developed / composed especially for the Brain Tech Israel 2013
conference this week.
In this project we created a musical soundtrack based on mind waves
transmitted from an EEG headset. The generated musical line is
parameterized according to levels of attention and meditation of the
headset wearer, leading the listener to unexpected musical realms which
somewhat correspond to his or her neuro-electric activity. One may try
to attain control over the musical line and advance within it through
deliberate control over levels of relaxation and concentration.
The EEG headset that was used for the project is `NueroSky MindWave
mobile <http://www.neurosky.com/Products/MindWaveMobile.aspx>`__. Music
was composed in \ `Ableton
Live <https://www.ableton.com/en/live/>`__ using Max for Live to read
the data from the headset.
Many thanks to Zvika Markfeld and Saron Paz from `ForReal
Team <http://forrealteam.com/>`__, the exhibition curators.
