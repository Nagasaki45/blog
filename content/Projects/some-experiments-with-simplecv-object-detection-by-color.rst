Computer vision is way far from my daily interest. But last weekend I
participated in a semi-hackathon, developing code that aims to detect
and track cards by their color.

Credits deserve to this
`guy <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jihxqg3kr-g>`__. I've used his
code as a reference and a starting point.

It is my first experience with SimpleCV. After all the code works pretty
well, I think, despite the awful documentation of SimpleCV and some hard
time working with the library.

As always, the code is written in python and is available
at \ `github <https://github.com/Nagasaki45/cards-tracker>`__. Any
thoughts about the mini-project, the code and computer vision
alternative libraries are always welcome.
