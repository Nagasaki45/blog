According to this blog title, there will be music involved.
It's been a while, but recently I started playing bass guitar in a
band again. The band,
"`Malinka <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXGJ2u2sw8sB6Jwa-63ATNw>`__\ ",
is lead by `Stav German <http://www.stavgerman.com/>`__, and we have our
`first live show next
week <https://www.facebook.com/events/1019498851418082/>`__ in Tel-Aviv.
Feel free to hear, comment, and come to the show, it's free.
